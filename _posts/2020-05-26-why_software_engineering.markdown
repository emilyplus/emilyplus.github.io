I designed my own MySpace page in HTML when I was 14.  I knew that I felt fulfilled by the joy of it, but didn't understand that I could pursue programming as a career, at that time.  Programming faded from my mind, and I pursued other interests.  Now, I have a master's degree in special education.  Unfortunately, jobs in public education on Long Island have been competitive, and I was forced to work for private education companies and edtech startups.  However, this was a disguised opportunity and the catalyst that launched me into exploring modern programming, engineering, and development.  First, I began supporting web developers to design a platform that would house professional development webinars for teachers who needed continuing education credits.  Then, I began to understand "wireframes" and completed UAT on test servers before they were pushed to production.  I started learning what "objects" were and how they could be manipulated.  I recently completed a self-paced MOOC through Udemy, Intro to Python Programming.  I was so excited when I ran my first script, after some trial and error, and the Chrome browser opened to a YouTube video!  I'm still excited to continue learning more.
